# Martian Token Crowdsale
![Planet Mars](application-image.png)
## Background
After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected me to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose me to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)</br>

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. I'll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
